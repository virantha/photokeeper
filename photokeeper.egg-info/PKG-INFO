Description: Photo Keeper - 
        =========================================

        Photo Keeper is a small script that I wrote to address the demise of my Eye-Fi Wifi SD card.
        This script will take a source directory (say the contents of a flash card from a camera), 
        scan all the image/video file EXIFs, and sort them into date-based folders in a user-specified
        directory.  It will optionally only copy files that have not already been copied (deduplication per 
        folder).  Photo Keeper can also upload all the files to Flickr into the same date-based album 
        structure, also taking care not to duplicate files.
        
        At some point, I intend to integrate this with the FlashAir series of cards for auto-uploads directly
        from the camera, but that is still a work in progress.

        * Sort image files (JPEG/TIFF) and video files into date-based folders (currently only YYYY-MM-DD format supported)
        * Upload images and videos to Flickr into date-based albums
        * Avoid duplication of files based on photo taken time, size, and filename

        Examine files
        -------------
        
        Examine the files in a given source directory (no changes or copying):
        
        ::
            
            photokeeper SRC_DIR examine
        
        Results in:

        Copy files to a directory
        -------------------------
        Copy the files in a given source directory to a target directory with no duplication:
        
        ::
        
        	photokeeper SRC_DIR TGT_DIR dedupe file
        
        
        Upload files to Flickr
        ----------------------
        First, go to Flickr and get a private key at http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
        Then, create a directory from where you will start photokeeper, and create a file called flickr_api.yaml:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
        .. code-block:: yaml                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
            key: "YOUR_API_KEY"

        Installation
        ############
        
        PhotoKeeper is currently only tested and provided for Python 3.5.  I have no
        plans to backport this to Python 2.x as I am shifting all my new development to
        3.x exclusively.
        
        .. code-block: bash
        
            $ pip install photokeeper
